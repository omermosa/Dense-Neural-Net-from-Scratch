# Dense-Neural-Net-from-Scratch
This a vectorized implementation of fully connected Artificial Nerual Net from scratch using numpy. The code in the notebook Neural Net Relu takes the number of layers of the network and the number of nodes of each layer, then builds the network, train it and outputs the accuracy, percision, recall, and f1 score. The implementaion was trained on a 6k 16 by 16 images with 10 classes, and tested on 5k images, giving accuracy of about 90%. Then, in the notebook named Neural Net, a distrotion percentage was introduced to the data to test how it would affect the accuracy of the model.
